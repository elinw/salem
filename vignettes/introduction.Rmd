The Salem package is based on the 
[https://www.tulane.edu/~salem/](The Salem Withcraft Website) created by
Richard Latner.  The package includes all of the data sets from the website
as R data frames.  The data have been reorganized from the original structure
for ease of use in R.  (Copies of the original tab delimited raw data sets
are available both at the Salem Witchcraft site and in the github respository
for this package.)
