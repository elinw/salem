The goal of salem is to provide access to data and other materials related to
the Salem Witchcraft Trials which took place in Salem, 
Massachusetts and the surrounding region in 1692. It is based on the work
of historian Richard Latner which is available at 
[The Salem Witchcraft Site](https://www.tulane.edu/~salem/).


## Installation

We're not on CRAN yet, but you can install the development version from
github. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elinw/salem")
```

The raw data from the website and the code used to convert it to R data frames
is available in the rawdata folder of this respository.
