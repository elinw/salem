The goal of salem is to provide access to data and other materials related to the Salem Witchcraft Trials which took place in Salem, Massachusetts and the surrounding region in 1692. It is based on the work of historian Richard Latner which is available at [The Salem Witchcraft Site](https://www.tulane.edu/~salem/).

Installation
------------

We're not on CRAN yet, but you can install the development version from github.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elinw/salem")
```

The raw data from the website and the code used to convert it to R data frames is available in the rawdata folder of this respository.
